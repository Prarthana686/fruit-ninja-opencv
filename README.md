Fruit Ninja – Hand Gesture Game 🎮🍎

The Fruit Ninja Hand Gesture Game is an interactive computer-vision project built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
It allows players to slice falling fruits in real time using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and interactive game logic using computer vision techniques.

🚀 Features

Slice fruits using hand gestures

Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe

Neon sword / slash visual effect

Fruit split animation on slicing

Bomb detection with game-over logic

Live score tracking

Works with a standard webcam

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Image processing and rendering

MediaPipe – Hand landmark detection

NumPy – Numerical operations

💡 How to Use

Create and activate a virtual environment
