**Fruit Ninja – Hand Gesture Game**

The Fruit Ninja Hand Gesture Game is a simple computer-vision project built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
It allows users to slice falling fruits in real time using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  
This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and basic game logic using computer vision.  
Interactive, lightweight, and easy to run using a standard webcam.

**Features**  
Slice fruits using hand gestures  
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe  
Neon sword / slash visual effect  
Fruit split animation on slicing  
Bomb detection with game-over logic  
Live score tracking  

**Tech Stack**  
Python – Core programming language  
OpenCV – Image processing and rendering  
MediaPipe – Hand landmark detection  
NumPy – Numerical operations  

**How to Use**  
Create and activate a virtual environment  
Install required dependencies  
Run the Python script  
Use your hand in front of the webcam to slice fruits  
Avoid bombs to keep the game running  

**Inspiration**  
Inspired by Fruit Ninja–style gesture-based games and computer-vision demos.  
Developed as a learning project with guidance and reference support.

**Disclaimer**  
This project is created for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with the official Fruit Ninja game.
